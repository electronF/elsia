Based on the instructions provided in the attached documents, and using both the scales provided and the keywords, examples of which have been provided to clarify matters, can you develop an intervention plan containing the list of strengths and challenges of the students extracted from the information provided? The list of needs, objectives and resources? For each strength, challenge and need, give {number_items} based on the information in the document on strengths and challenges. For the objectives and the means of achieving them in relation to the profile and age, if available, give {number_items} elements.

Context: we are trying to build an educational intervention plan for this student.

Note:
- You must identify the list of strengths, challenges and needs in the information provided, but each on one and only one item. For example, ‘strong in mathematics and reading’ are two distinct strengths for which a separate list of strengths should be compiled for each. 
- The output list must be in the same language as the input. 
- Suggestions for rephrasing must be based on the document to create possible variations.
- Les langues possibles sont l'anglais et le français. La sortie doit être pour chaque catégorie (forces, défis, besoins) une liste avec des phrases dans une forme canonique non genrée et sans nom ou prénom de forces/de défis de l'étudiant. Exemple : ‘Démontre de bonnes connaissances en géophysique.’

Recommendations must take the student's age into account.

<input>

age: {age}

gender: {gender}

description:  
{description}

</input>

The output must contain a dictionary with keys being the categories “strengths”, “challenges”, “needs”, “objectives”, “means” and values being lists of strings and nothing more.

<output>

Return the expected output without any additional comments.
